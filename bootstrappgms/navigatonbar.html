        The mysteries of an ancient civilization that survived for more than a millennium on the island of Malta—and
        then collapsed within two generations—have been unravelled by archaeologists who analyzed pollen buried deep
        within the earth and ancient DNA from skulls and bones. It’s part of a field of work that is expanding the use
        of archaeological techniques into environments where they were previously thought to be unusable.

        The Temple Culture of the Maltese archipelago in the Mediterranean began nearly 6,000 years ago and at its
        height probably numbered several thousand people—far denser than the people of mainland Europe could manage at
        the time. The island people constructed elaborate sacred sites, such as the famous Ġgantija temple complex, and
        their buildings are among the earliest free-standing buildings known. But, after 1,500 years, they were gone.

        Islands can be used as laboratories for understanding change in the wider world.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Caroline Malone, prehistory specialist at Queen’s University Belfast, Northern Ireland, wanted to understand how
        the fragile island ecology sustained the people for so long despite drought, violent storms, and soil
        erosion—and why it ultimately failed. She ran an ambitious project, Fragsus, which drew on multiple tools to
        find some answers. Scientists drilled earth cores ranging from eight to 30 meters deep, dating the sediment
        using carbon dating to understand which time period it referred to. They counted the pollen at two-centimeter
        intervals and analyzed individual pollen grains using chemical signatures imprinted by the surrounding
        environment to understand what nutrients the parent plants were absorbing from the ground. Molluscs embedded in
        the soil revealed glimpses of the landscape since “snails,” Malone said, “are very particular about where they
        live and don’t move far.”
